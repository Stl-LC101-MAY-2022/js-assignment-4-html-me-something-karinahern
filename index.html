            <h2>Croatia</h2>
            <h3>Krka National Park, Skradinski Buk Waterfall</h3>
            <img src="Images/krka.JPG" alt="Krka National Park">
            <p>
               Krka National Park is known for it's series of 7 waterfalls and it is home to the most beautiful 
               water fall I have every seen. I had the privilege of visiting both Krka National Park and Plitvice 
               Lakes National Park when I visited Croatia in 2017. While both parks are hosts to a plethora of natural beauty,
               Krka is my favorite. Krka National Park &gt; Plitvice Lakes National Park. I remember the water roaring so loud you couldn't pay attention to anything else,
               I remember the mist kissing my face, and I remember the trees offering me shade from the sun. Best of all, 
               I remember doubting reality. Have you ever seen soemthing so beautiful you start to think you made it up?

            <img src = "Images/desert.JPG" alt = "Sahara Desert">
            <p>
               Sitting at the top of a sand dune watching the sun set was one of the most humbling experiences of my life. 
               I sat there playing with the sand as I looked into the abyss of sand all around me. I tried to grab handfuls, 
               but the sand was so tiny, almost nanoscopic, so it kept sifting through my fingers. If in this universe I am a speck of dust, I questioned
               if I truly existed.

            <h2>Sedona, Arizona, USA</h2>
            <h3>Devil's Bridge</h3>
            <img src = "Images/sedona.jpg" alt = "Devils Bridge">
            <p>
               Devil's Bridge Trail is rated "moderately difficult," but there is nothing moderate about it. There are many vantage points 
               throughout the trail-I know because I take many stops. My favorite vantage point is right before you reach the bridge. 
               I always give up at this point, but each time I'm pleasently surprised by a clear view of red rocks and tree tops. Seeing 
               natural beauty like the one Sedona offers always feels like God's personal gift to me.
